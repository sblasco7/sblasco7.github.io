				<p class = "job_desc"> Based on my experience as a commecial analyst I began learning both Tableau and R in 2018, then began practicing

					courses on platformas like EDX and Coursera while at the same time making my own projects for fun. 
					<br>
					<br>
					My philosophy is that of accesibility, for that reason I'm currently learning to use the main R libraries for 
					visualizations, interactivity and deployment of user friendly dashboards. In that vein I'm also learning a bit of 
					user interface desing and web standards.
					<br>

					Side note: I'm also an avid day trader.
