    <p class="lead"> Hello, I'm Simon Blasco, I am Venezuelan Economist with a knack for finding answers and making
    evidence based conections between all kinds of things. I pride myself of being a life long learner and great at
    teaching, of identifying problems and being creative at inventing solutions.
    <br><br>
    The web page you are in right now was born out of the need for a place to put the product of latest avenues of learning
    that i've decided to undertake during the 2020 quarantine, this being primarily learning R and HTML.
    <br><br>
    If you would like to know what I can do I recommend going to the main post as it is where the latest project will be posted,
    a little about my profesional history lies below (you may expand upon it by pressing to expand each panel)

        <h2>Freelance Data Analyst</h2>

    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-6">
            <p class="overflow-hidden" style="height:460px;"> Based on my experience as a commecial analyst I began learning both Tableau and R in 2018, then began practicing
                cleaning data online as an income source on the side, ever since I've completed several data analytics
                courses on platformas like EDX and Coursera while at the same time making my own projects for fun.
                <br><br>
                My philosophy is that of accesibility, for that reason I'm currently learning to use the main R libraries for
                visualizations, interactivity and deployment of user friendly dashboards. In that vein I'm also learning a bit of
                user interface desing and web standards.
                <br><br>
                Side note: I'm also an avid day trader.

        <h2>Account Manager</h2>

    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-6">
            <p class="overflow-hidden" style="height:460px;">I was an account manager for Upthetrade, a Chilean startup competitor to the monolithic NIElSEN
            assigned to none othe than Walmart Chile, I was in charge of reporting sell out data and analytics, as well as designing presentations,
            keeping track of deliverables and assuring quality control. I improved response times in regards to the ad-hoc request by the client's team.
            serving as much as triple the weekly ticket.
            <br><br>
            I designed various dashboards that helped category managers benchmark their market share and performance in different
            time frames and geographical clusters. (This was the time a began to fall in love with bussiness inteligence)
            <br><br>
            The most fun I had was when we led a data extraction project with Walmart's pricing team by serving as coordinator
            between both IT departments, commercial, and management.
            <br><br>
            This job was so much fun it impacted me to this day, while at the same time being the most stresful one I've had
            (And i was a commecial banking Executive during the Venezuelan hiperinflation crisis)
            I learned SQL and Tableau, I found out and provided evidence of the way cellphone Apps were pilfering transit from
            brick and mortar stores, found gaps in the veggie section display as compared to the rest of their competition, I revised
            and corrected numerous error in my own companie's (very big) data set and had a glimpse of the power of big data.

            <br><br>
            I was an account executive for Banesco Banco Universal in Caracas Venezuela, helping a team manage a corporate
            client portfolio and all their banking products, we continually kept hitting production goals in a variety of
            measures, improving value for the bank. During this time i learned about commercial banking and client maintenance in
            a bussiness to bussiness setting, as all my prior experiences where in retail banking.
            <br><br>
            We won a yearly competition that entailed having the highest portfolio growth in every measure, which earned us
            a week in a Dominican Republic resort, all included.
